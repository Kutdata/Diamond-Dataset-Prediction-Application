# Diamond-Dataset-Prediction-Application
Data analysis, modeling of the diamond data set in the Seaborn library and converting the prediction based on the model into an exe file.

I analyzed the diamond data set, modeled it and made predictions. For my model, I divided the dataset into high and low priced diamonds. So I made an application that can make predictions.

My MSE and R2 values:
MSE for high-priced diamonds: 1632798.3066681314, R2: 0.7559360452633883
MSE for low-priced diamonds: 101974.21054677841, R2: 0.9818849353600754
